<b>Challenge 1</b>
<p>The LandingActivity interacts with the Spaceship model object we created. Start by setting spaceship to a new Spaceship object in the onCreate() method. Use the custom constructor that takes a String parameter, and pass in "FIREFLY" as the parameter.</p>
<b>Challenge 2</b>
<p>Now that we have a model object, update the TextView to use the Spaceship's shipType property. Remember to use the helpful getter method!</p>
<b>Challenge 3</b>
<p>Finally, notice that our Spaceship class has a new field to store the number of passengers in the ship. Use the method to get the number of passengers for spaceship, and then set the text for passengersField to this value. Note: You will need to convert the int value to a String!</p>

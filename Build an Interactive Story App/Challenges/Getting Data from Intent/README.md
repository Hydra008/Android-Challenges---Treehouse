<b>Challenge 1</b>
<p>
We previously added a FUEL_LEVEL to our spacecraft. Now in FlightActivity, we want to get the value that we put in the Intent. Start by declaring an Intent variable and getting the Intent used to start this Activity.</p>
<b>Challenge 2</b>
<p>Now set fuelLevel to the value from the Intent. Check the Intent documentation if you need help finding the correct method to use. Use "FUEL_LEVEL" as the 'name' and -1 as the 'defaultValue'.</p>
